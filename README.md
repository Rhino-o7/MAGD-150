# MAGD-150
## Projects from the MAGD-150 class using p5.js

## Project 2
**This project’s goal was to create a scene in space.** <br>
I used ellipses to create the planet and stars. I used quads to create the parts of the ship.

## Project 4
**The goal of this project was to create movement and use mouse inputs.** <br>
When you click on the canvas a new square will pop up and start to bounce left and right off of the canvas walls. If the square is moving right, it will be green and if it is moving left, it will be red.

## Project 7
**This project’s goal was to create movement with an array of objects.** <br>
I created an array of pumpkins that fall down from the top of the canvas and if the mouse appears in front of a pumpkin, a face will appear on the pumpkin.
